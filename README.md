## This is a repository mostly for the purpose of teaching myself Git-Hub and Hugo on a Raspberry Pi 3. 

## Git-Hub

My ultimate goal is to be fluent in my usage  and understanding of Git-Hub so I may use it for future projects and hopefully once my skill in programming
is elevated (significantly) I can start contributing. 

## [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Years ago I started learning HTML, CSS, and some JavaScipt. I quickly found more interest in creating the final product of a website and moved to 
WordPress, a well known and commonly used CMS. Since then and after creating various websites on hosted servers I recently stumbled across Hugo while 
searching for a more light-weight solution that could run on a Raspberry Pi without difficulty. I'm hoping to gain further understanding of the framework 
and use it as a blog for my future endavors as I start my journey in computer sciences.
