&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world-introduction&#34;&gt;Hello World! &amp;amp; Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-blog-post-and-an-intro&#34;&gt;My first blog post, and an Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is mostly a to test the usage and properties of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; as this and all future blog posts will be written in it. It&amp;rsquo;s also a post to explain a little bit about why this blog exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Bailey, and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning my journey towards a career in Computer Science (CS). I am writing this blog to use as a tool for learning in hopes that coming back and explaining in detail the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, it will reinforce what I will be learning at the time. I&amp;rsquo;m also hoping that it will eventually be a portfolio of my projects showing the improvement I&amp;rsquo;ve made and the skills I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. This blog is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 running a LAMP stack. The site was generated using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in Go Lang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preface:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in computers since I was very young. I started dabbling with programming in 7th grade when A friend of mine first introduced me to Batch, HTML, and CSS. During that time I found joy in being able to create with nothing but lines of code. I thought it was amazing that someone could control a computer, and use that control to make the computer do virtually anything! I was hooked. Not long after, I found an interest in arduino&amp;rsquo;s, but along with all the other parts of being a kid, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much past making LED&amp;rsquo;s blink. Even buying the book C++ Primer (Fifth Edition) didn&amp;rsquo;t spur me on like I thought it would. I wanted to do more, but it seemed to complicated at the time. I started playing Minecrft and after getting into that for awhile and playing with others online, I started building websites for servers I played on, and eventually for a server I ran myself. I eventually grew bored of writing websites in HTML &amp;amp; CSS so I moved to learning a Content Management System (CMS). I of course found &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used and well documented CMS. Some time later I stumbled across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. After purchasing a Raspberry Pi 2, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to do with it. I knew what Linux was, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t really used it for more than an hour at a time, and that was just to test it out. I knew though that it had all the capabilities to become something cool, all I had to do though was think of what that something was. Easier said than done of course. Of course the first project I attempted was an 8x8x8 LED Matrix Display. Horrible choice as a beginner project, at least with where my skill level was at that point. I did successfully create the cube! That is, I was able to solder the LED&amp;rsquo;s and wire&amp;rsquo;s together correctly to where it functioned as intended, if the function is to only light up one LED at a time by applying voltage &amp;amp; current from a power supply to one row and one column at a time. I was never able to read the wiring diagram for how to construct the circuit needed to drive the Matrix Display, which meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t even make it to the programming point in that project&amp;hellip; Since then I have tried to take a better approach in my learning by being realistic in my project goals and being more logical in my methods of learning. I am now pretty familiar and fluent using the Linux CLI. I have 3 Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, each having it&amp;rsquo;s own tasks. I run various &amp;lsquo;self-hosted&amp;rsquo; services and softwares on them. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of the open source home automation software &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.home-assistant.io/&#34;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;m integrating into my home in every place I can find and for every purpose I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
